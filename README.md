* The training and validation sets are derived from a public dataset. This public dataset can be available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stoicstatic/face-recognition-dataset.
* Please comply with the usage requirements of the original authors of the publicly available dataset.
* The dataset processing is organized in this code.
* In the application part of the model, it can be tested by uploading data from a local computer. Note that the upload should be a compressed package in the format .zip. This zip contains two folders inside. One is the query image folder, which contains only one image of the face to be recognized. The other is the support set folder, which contains multiple face images of different people.
* Note that all output from the code has been cleared.
